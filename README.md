# dockerfile-builder

With this project you can select the bears you want and create a docker image
with just those bears. No more installing the entire Haskell ecosystem when
you just want to do a puny indent check with PEP8Bear.

### Running the server

Simply serve the directory on a port and open root in a browser and select the
bears you want. A Dockerfile should be created on the right.
